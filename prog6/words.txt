Let us enjoy reading this story of The Lion and The Mouse.
A lion was sleeping in a forest. A mouse started playing on it. The lion was disturbed and arose from his sleep. It caught up the mouse angrily and tried to crush it to death.
Then the mouse prayed the lion to leave him off and assured that it would help him when it needed. The lion laughed at it and let him off.
One day the lion was caught in a net spread by a hunter. It roared and tried to escape but in vain. The mouse heared the lion's roaring and came there. It started cutting the net with its teeth. The lion escaped and thanked the mouse.
MORAL : Everything has its own value.
